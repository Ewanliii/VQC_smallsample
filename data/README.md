# Data Description

This directory contains subsampled datasets derived from a large-scale original dataset 
(approximately 600,000 samples), which cannot be redistributed due to license restrictions.

Dataset source:
- IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)

Please download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data
and follow the preprocessing instructions provided in `data/processed/README.md`.

These subsampled datasets are used consistently across all experiments to ensure
fair comparison between different models and circuit architectures.
