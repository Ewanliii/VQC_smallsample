Each subfolder contains experimental content required for different dimensions. Taking D16 as an example (D8 and D32 follow the same principle), the contents include:
y_labels.npy: Labels corresponding to each row of Zdae_encoder.pt: Weights for the DAE encoder
imputer.joblib: Rules for imputing missing values
scaler.joblib: Rules for standardization
