Code and data for the paper ：Exploring the Role of Structural Induction Bias in Variational Quantum Circuits under Imbalanced Low-Data Conditions

> **Title:** Exploring the Role of Structural Induction Bias in Variational Quantum Circuits under Imbalanced Low-Data Conditions
> **Author:** Jiahua Li 
> **Status:** Under review / Preprint

## 📌 Overview
We investigate how different variational quantum circuit (VQC) structures affect classification
performance in small-sample, high-dimensional regimes. Experiments are conducted under varying
dataset sizes and feature dimensions.
